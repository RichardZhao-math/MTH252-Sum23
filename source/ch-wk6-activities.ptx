  <title>Week 6 Activities</title>

  <introduction>

    <p> 
      The activities for this week will ask you to explore some strategies to evaluate trigonometric integrals. 
      Two of the advantages of working with trigonometric integrals are
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            There are a lot of trigonometric identities that allow us to convert the integrand to a form we desire. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The derivatives and integrals of some trigonometric functions are periodic (for example, the derivative and integral of sine and cosine are just going back and forth between them). 
            This can reduce the type of functions we need to deal with. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Recall the whole idea of the trigonometric substitution you learned this week is to turn an un-simplified-able expression to a trigonometric expression, and we can manipulate it using trigonometric identities to help us evaluate the integrals, typically using <m>u</m>-sub or integration by parts. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To help us with the method of trigonometric substitution, it will be beneficial to know some of the strategies and formulas to deal with trigonometric integrals.

    <p>
      When you are ready to investigate some of the trigonometric integrals, click the buttons below and work through the tasks following the prompts. 
      You are more than welcome to work with your classmates collaboratively but you will need to write up your own work. 
      When you completed all the tasks, format your work into a <alert>single pdf file</alert> and submit it in the corresponding assignment dropbox on Canvas.
