  <title>Exam Review</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      There are three exams during the term: two midterm exams and a cumulative final exam.  
    </p>

    <p>
      You can find more exam information in the corresponding modules in Canvas. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of this page is to provide you with some practice problems that you may consider working through in preparation of the exams. 
      You don't need to complete all the problems nor turning in anything here. 
      Answer keys are provided solely for you to check your answers. 
      If you have questions about the work, feel free to reach out to Richard. 
      Remember that he values work and thought process a lot more than just having the correct answer!
