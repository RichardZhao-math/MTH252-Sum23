  <title>What's the "best" way to evaluate integrals?</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Back in the 1990s, an instructor placed the following integral question at the beginning of a final exam in an integral calculus course:
        <me>
          \int \frac{x}{9 - x^2}\, dx
        </me>
        <p>
          Imagine you were a student taking this exam, how would you try evaluating this integral?
        </p>
      </p>
    </introduction>
    
    <exercises>
      <title>Part (a): First approach</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            What is the <alert>first method</alert> you would try to evaluate this integral? 
            Clearly state your reasoning for choosing this method as your first approach. 
            Then carry out the integration using this method and show all steps clearly. 
          </p>

          <p>
            <alert>P.S.:</alert> The goal isn't to figure out the answer, but to determine what your go-to method is to evaluate this integral. 
            So be honest to yourself and stick with your first choice. 
            If it will work out, great! If not, just try to make as much progress as possible. 
          </p>
        </statement>
    </exercises>

    <exercises>
      <title>Part (b): Alternative approach</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Now, come up with a <alert>different method</alert> that could also be used to evaluate the same integral. 
          Briefly explain why you believe this alternative method is valid and likely to succeed. 
          Then, evaluate the integral using this second method, again showing all steps clearly.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercises>
    
    <exercises>
      <title>Part (c): Compare and reflect</title>
        <p>
          When you complete the above tasks, expand the solution below and check your answer. 
        </p>
        <solution>
          <title>Don't peek until you have finished the first two parts!</title>
          
          
          <p>
            We can evaluate this integral using three methods we have learned in this class: they are <m>u</m>-sub, trig sub, and partial fraction decomposition. 
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Using <m>\boldsymbol{u}</m>-sub: </alert> 
                Let <m>u = 9 - x^2</m>. Then <m>du = -2x\, dx</m>. 
                Hence, we obtain
              </p>
              <md>
                <mrow>\int \frac{x}{9 - x^2}\, dx \amp = -\int \frac{1}{2u}\, du </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = -\frac{1}{2}\ln|u| + C </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = -\frac{1}{2}\ln\left|9 - x^2\right| + C </mrow>
              </md>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Using Trig sub: </alert> 
                Let <m>x = 3\sin(\theta)</m>. Then <m>dx = 3\cos(\theta)\, d\theta</m>. 
                Hence, we obtain
              </p>
              <md>
                <mrow>\int \frac{x}{9 - x^2}\, dx \amp = \int \frac{3\sin(\theta)}{9 - 9\sin^2(\theta)}\cdot 3\cos(\theta)\, d\theta </mrow>

              <p>
                where <m>C = \ln(3) + C_0</m>. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Using Partial Fraction: </alert> 
                Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two numbers. Note that
              </p>
              <me>
                \frac{x}{9 - x^2} = \frac{x}{(3 - x)(3 + x)} = \frac{A}{3 - x} + \frac{B}{3 + x}
              </me>
              <p>
                This implies that
              </p>
              <me>
                x = A(x + 3) + B(x - 3)
              </me>
              <p>
                We can determine that <m>A = \dfrac{1}{2}</m> and <m>B = -\dfrac{1}{2}</m>. 
                Hence, we obtain

                <mrow>\int \frac{x}{9 - x^2}\, dx \amp = \int \left(\frac{1/2}{3 - x} + \frac{-1/2}{3 + x}\right)\, dx </mrow>

        <statement>
          <p>
            Grade your work, out of 10 for each part, using the solution provided above. Then write a short reflection that addresses the following prompts: 
            <ul>

                        The instructor put this integral question in the beginning of the final exam, hoping to bolster students' confidence. 
                        Do you think their goal is well accomplished using your first approach? 
                        Why or why not? 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How does this task affect your strategies to evaluate indefinite integrals? 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For example, we have learned many methods to evaluate integrals. In what order would you try the method (like, what should be your go-to method); 
                      If you get stuck on a problem, what should you do? 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            It will be beneficial to have a strategic plan to evaluate integrals (like, if I see this, I should try this method; I should try this method before I try out a second method, or things like that to help you evaluate integrals). 
            You don't have to include your strategic plan in your submission but it is a good idea to have one to help you determine which method you should use. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            Stay tuned as Richard will update the "official" strategic plan here after the due date.

      <title>How do I know what method I should try... </title>
      
        <p>
          Julie walked through the strategies in the lecture video (and I think a lot of you are following it as well). 
          In the spirit of keeping an record of the methods we have learned, I put a brief strategic plan on the methods. 
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Always try <alert>simplification</alert> first! 
              Do any algebraic simplification possible! 
              If we can make the integrand a lot simpler to deal with, why not!?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <alert><m>\boldsymbol{u}</m>-sub</alert> is the method you should try next. 
              Recall <m>u</m>-sub came from the chain rule you learned in calculus 1, which means you may want to be able to find the derivative of the choice of <m>u</m> in the integrand. 
              Long story short, the <m>u</m>-sub formula is
              <me>
                \int f'(u(x))\cdot u'(x)\, dx = f(u(x)) + C
              </me>
              Just make sure you don't end up getting a more complicated integral after <m>u</m>-sub. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you see two functions being multiplied in the integrand, you may want to consider using <alert>integration by parts</alert> since this method came from the product rule in derivative. 
              You will want to pick a <m>u</m> and the rest of the integral will be the <m>dv</m>. 
              Long story short, the integration by parts formula is
              <me>
                \int u\, dv = uv - \int v\, du
              </me>
              You may be wondering how we can pick a <m>u</m> to make the problem easier. 
              There is an acronym "LIPET" to help us pick a good <m>u</m> (you can look up the LIPET test if you want to know further). 
              This acronym LIPET tells us that we should pick the <m>u</m> in the following order: 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <alert>L</alert> stands for Logarithmic functions; 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <alert>LI</alert> stands for Inverse Trigonometric functions; 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <alert>P</alert> stands for Polynomial functions; 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <alert>E</alert> stands for Exponential functions; 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <alert>T</alert> stands for Trigonometric functions; 
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              Well... Exponential and Trigonometric functions are equally complicated when picking them for the <m>u</m>...  
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There are also two special methods we learned that only works if the situation fits. 
              They are: 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <alert>Trigonometric Substitution</alert>: If you see <m>a^2 - x^2</m> in the integrand, you may consider using the substitution that <m>x = a\sin(\theta)</m>. 
                    Likewise, if you see <m>a^2 + x^2</m> in the integrand, you may consider using the substitution that <m>x = a\tan(\theta)</m>. 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <alert>Partial Fraction Decomposition</alert>: If you see a complicated <em>proper</em> fraction where the denominator happens to be reducible (fancy way of saying factor-able), then partial fraction decomposition will help you split up the fraction to smaller pieces. 
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          As you saw in this task that sometimes we can evaluate an integral using multiple methods. Trying easier method first is always a good idea. 
          If you get stuck, try something else! 
        </p>
