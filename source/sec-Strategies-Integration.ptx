  <title>What's the "best" way to evaluate integrals?</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Back in the 1990s, an instructor placed the following integral question at the beginning of a final exam in an integral calculus course:
        <me>
          \int \frac{x}{9 - x^2}\, dx
        </me>
        <p>
          Imagine you were a student taking this exam, how would you try evaluating this integral?
        </p>
      </p>
    </introduction>
    
    <exercises>
      <title>Part (a): First approach</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            What is the <alert>first method</alert> you would try to evaluate this integral? 
            Clearly state your reasoning for choosing this method as your first approach. 
            Then carry out the integration using this method and show all steps clearly. 
          </p>

          <p>
            <alert>P.S.:</alert> The goal isn't to figure out the answer, but to determine what your go-to method is to evaluate this integral. 
            So be honest to yourself and stick with your first choice. 
            If it will work out, great! If not, just try to make as much progress as possible. 
          </p>
        </statement>
    </exercises>

    <exercises>
      <title>Part (b): Alternative approach</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Now, come up with a <alert>different method</alert> that could also be used to evaluate the same integral. 
          Briefly explain why you believe this alternative method is valid and likely to succeed. 
          Then, evaluate the integral using this second method, again showing all steps clearly.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <title>Part (c): Compare and reflect</title>

          When you complete the above tasks, expand the solution below and check your answer.

          <title>Don't peek until you have finished the first two parts!</title>
          
          
          <p>
            We can evaluate this integral using three methods we have learned in this class: they are <m>u</m>-sub, trig sub, and partial fraction decomposition. 
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Using <m>\boldsymbol{u}</m>-sub: </alert> 
                Let <m>u = 9 - x^2</m>. Then <m>du = -2x\, dx</m>. 
                Hence, we obtain
              </p>
              <md>
                <mrow>\int \frac{x}{9 - x^2}\, dx \amp = -\int \frac{1}{2u}\, du </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = -\frac{1}{2}\ln|u| + C </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = -\frac{1}{2}\ln\left|9 - x^2\right| + C </mrow>
              </md>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Using Trig sub: </alert> 
                Let <m>x = 3\sin(\theta)</m>. Then <m>dx = 3\cos(\theta)\, d\theta</m>. 
                Hence, we obtain
              </p>
              <md>
                <mrow>\int \frac{x}{9 - x^2}\, dx \amp = \int \frac{3\sin(\theta)}{9 - 9\sin^2(\theta)}\cdot 3\cos(\theta)\, d\theta </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = \int \frac{9\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{9\cos^2(\theta)}\, d\theta </mrow>

              </md>
              <p>
                where <m>C = \ln(3) + C_0</m>. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Using Partial Fraction: </alert> 
                Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two numbers. Note that
              </p>
              <me>
                \frac{x}{9 - x^2} = \frac{x}{(3 - x)(3 + x)} = \frac{A}{3 - x} + \frac{B}{3 + x}
              </me>
              <p>
                This implies that
              </p>
              <me>
                x = A(x + 3) + B(x - 3)
              </me>
              <p>
                We can determine that <m>A = \dfrac{1}{2}</m> and <m>B = -\dfrac{1}{2}</m>. 
                Hence, we obtain
              </p>
              <md>
                <mrow>\int \frac{x}{9 - x^2}\, dx \amp = \int \left(\frac{1/2}{3 - x} + \frac{-1/2}{3 + x}\right)\, dx </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{2} \int \left(\frac{1}{3 - x} - \frac{1}{3 + x}\right) \, dx </mrow>

            </li>
          </ol>
        </solution>
        
        <statement>
          <p>
            Grade your work, out of 10 for each part, using the solution provided above. Then write a short reflection that addresses the following prompts: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The instructor put this integral question in the beginning of the final exam, hoping to bolster students' confidence. 
                        Do you think their goal is well accomplished using your first approach? 
                        Why or why not? 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How does this task affect your strategies to evaluate indefinite integrals? 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For example, we have learned many methods to evaluate integrals. In what order would you try the method (like, what should be your go-to method); 
                      If you get stuck on a problem, what should you do? 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            It will be beneficial to have a strategic plan to evaluate integrals (like, if I see this, I should try this method; I should try this method before I try out a second method, or things like that to help you evaluate integrals). 
            You don't have to include your strategic plan in your submission but it is a good idea to have one to help you determine which method you should use. 
          </p>

            Stay tuned as Richard will update the "official" strategic plan here after the due date.

    <title>When you complete the tasks... </title>
    <p>
      Come up with a strategic plan to evaluate integrals (you don't have to turn this in. Just make sure you have a plan that you can rely on when evaluating integrals in the future).
