  <introduction>
    
    <p>
      We learned multiple methods to evaluate integrals in this class. They are
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Evaluate integrals using one of the known integral formulas; 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>u</m>-substitution; 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Integration by parts; 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Trigonometric Substitution; 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Partial Fraction Decomposition. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      But that's a lot of methods throwing at us... 
      In practice, sometimes it is difficult to pick which method to use 
      (unless Richard is being nice and provide the method... But we can't always count on him). 
    </p>

    <p>
      Well it turns out that sometimes students getting stuck in a problem not because they pick the wrong method, but rather an <em>inefficient</em> method that makes the work ten times harder. 
      You want to know how to pick not only a correct method, but also an efficient method to evaluate integrals. 
    </p>
    
    <p> 
      The activities for this week will ask you to explore various techniques to evaluate integrals, and compare and contrast different methods to evaluate the same integral. 
    </p>

    <p>
      When you completed all the tasks, format your work into a single pdf file and submit it in the corresponding assignment dropbox on Canvas.
