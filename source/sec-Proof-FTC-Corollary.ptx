  <title>Justifying An Corollary of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Well the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part II, isn't the theorem we use a lot. 
      Instead, we use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part I, a lot to help us evaluate definite integrals. 
      This is actually a (most useful) corollary of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. 
      The theorem is presented in your textbook page 318. 
      I also included it below: 
    </p>

    <corollary xml:id="cor-FTC">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Assume that <m>a &lt; b</m> and that <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>. 
          If <m>F</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>, then
          <men xml:id="eqn-cor-FTC">
            \int_a^b f(x)\, dx = F(b) - F(a)
          </men>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>

    <p>
      Julie (and your textbook) provided a proof to this corollary by using the mean value theorem. 
      We will approach things differently by proving this result using the accmulation function and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus you proved in the previous investigation. 
    </p> 

    <p>
      <alert>P.S.:</alert> The tasks below seem long but they are mostly procedures to follow. 
      The goal here is to convince you the facts in each part are true. 
    </p>
  </introduction>
  
  <exercises>
  <title>Part (a): How "different" are all the antiderivatives of a function? </title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's take a step back a bit to section 5.3 about antiderivatives now. 
        Recall the antiderivative of a function isn't unique (so a function can have a gazillon of different antiderivatives).
        But how different are the antiderivatives of a function? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Well we know the answer: <alert>All the antiderivatives of a function should differ by a constant</alert>! 
        This fact is being captured by the theorem in your textbook page 310 (I also included it below). 
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm-GeneralAntiderivative">
        <title>The General Antiderivative</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>y = F(x)</m> be an antiderivative of <m>y = f(x)</m> on <m>(a,b)</m>. 
            Then every antiderivative on <m>(a,b)</m> is of the form of <m>y = F(x) + C</m> for some constant <m>C</m>. 
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        This is also the reason why we always need to stick a <m>+ C</m> everytime we find the indefinite integrals since the indefinite integral of a function is defined as its general antiderivative.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Your job in this part is to explain <alert>why</alert> all antiderivatives of a function only differ by a constant. 
      </p>
    </statement>
    
    <hint>
      <title>If you need help on the steps of the proof...</title>
      <p>
        Well your textbook includes the proof for sure. 
        Yet, your textbook simply quoted the mean value theorem. 
        Try to explain what is really going mathematically rather than simply quoting the MVT. 
        I also broke down the proof into the following steps for you to follow. 
      </p>
      <ol marker="(i)">
        <li>
          <p>
            Since we want to figure out how <em>different</em> the antiderivatives of a function are, let's pick two arbitrary antiderivative of a function, called <m>y = F(x)</m> and <m>y = G(x)</m>. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Well we want to find the difference of them, so let's subtract them and name the difference <m>H</m>. 
            That is, we define <m>H(x) = G(x) - F(x)</m>. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What do we know about the difference, <m>H</m>? 
            Well one thing we know is the derivative of <m>H</m> for sure. 
            Richard claimed that <m>H'(x) = 0</m>... 
            Why so? 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Put on your calculus 1 thinking cap! 
            What type of function will have the derivative of <m>0</m>? 
            This will help you wrap up the argument. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </hint>

    <solution>
      <p>
        The whole idea of this argument relies on the fact that only constants will give the derivative of 0. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the argument more rigorous, we will let <m>F</m> and <m>G</m> be some antiderivative of the same function <m>f</m>. 
        That is, <m>F' = f</m> and <m>G' = f</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we care about the difference of them, let's define their difference to be <m>H</m> where <m>H(x) = F(x) - G(x)</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We can certainly take the derivative of <m>H</m>! By the linearity, we have
        <md>
          <mrow> H'(x) \amp = \big(F(x) - G(x)\big)' </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = F'(x) - G'(x) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = f(x) - f(x) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = 0 </mrow>
        </md>
        So we know the derivative of the difference is 0. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What do we know about the type of function whose derivative is 0... Well from calculus 1, we know that (only) constant functions will have the derivative of 0. 
        That is, <m>H(x) = C</m> for some random constant <m>C</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting everything together, we know that <m>F(x) - G(x) = C</m>, which implies that <m>F(x) = G(x) + C</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you see where the <m>+ C</m> comes from! 
      </p>
    </solution>

  </exercises>

  <exercises>
  <title>Part (b): Prove the Corollary of the FTC</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m> be a continuous function on <m>[a,b]</m>. 
        By <xref ref="cor-FTC"/>, it seems like the theorem works with any antiderivative of <m>f</m>. 
        Well, we proved in the first investigation this week that the accumulation function, <m>A</m>, is an antiderivative! 
        So the theorem should work if we use <m>A</m> in replace of <m>F</m> in the theorem. 
        We will prove 
        <me>
          \int_a^b f(x)\, dx = A(b) - A(a)
        </me>
        instead and the actual proof will just be slightly different (but the idea remains!). 
      </p>

      <p>
        I will again code a pretty picture below to help you visualize the situation: 
      </p>

          \end{tikzpicture}
        </latex-image>

      </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        See that there is another value, <m>c</m>, on the <m>x</m>-axis. 
        Symbolically speaking, it doesn't matter where <m>c</m> is located but let's put it to the left of <m>a</m>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason why we needed an additional value of <m>c</m> here is to work with the accumulation function. 
        Let's quickly (re)define the accumulation function slightly bit different (simply because <m>a</m> is being taken for something else). 
        <me>
          A(x) = \int_c^x f(t)\, dt
        </me>
        
      </p>

      <p>
        Now your job in this part is to argue why the following equation
        <me>
          \int_a^b f(t)\, dt = A(b) - A(a)
        </me>
        is true by answering the following sub-questions: 
        <ol marker="(1)">
          <li>
            <p>
              Which area in the picture, in terms of color, is represented by <m>\int_a^b f(t)\, dt</m>. What about <m>A(b)</m> and <m>A(a)</m>?  
            </p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <p>
              Rewrite <m>A(b)</m> using ONE definite integral. Then rewrite <m>A(a)</m> using another definite integral. 
              Be careful about the limits of integration for both integrals. 
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Now simplify <m>A(b) - A(a)</m> by condensing it to ONE single integral. 
              If you play your cards right, the answer will be <m>\int_a^b f(x)\, dt</m> since the colors should match. 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement> 

    <hint>
      <title>If you need help on condensing the integrals...</title>
      <p>
        In the lecture video of section 5.2, Julie went through a couple properties of definite integrals. 
        You will need two of them to condense the two definite integrals into <m>\int_b^a f(t)\, dt</m>. 
        They are
        <me>
          \int_b^a f(t)\, dt = -\int_a^b f(t)\, dt
        </me>
        and
        <me>
          \int_a^c f(t)\, dt = \int_a^b f(t)\, dt + \int_b^c f(t)\, dt
        </me>
        Well the <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> represent different things so you probably want to sort out the symbols a bit. 
      </p>
    </hint>

    <solution>
      <p>
        Using the definition of the accumulation function in the prompt, we know that
        <me>
          A(b) = \int_c^b f(x)\, dx \quad \text{ and }\quad
          A(a) = \int_c^a f(x)\, dx 
        </me>
        Using the properties of definite integrals, we have
        <md>
          <mrow> A(b) - A(a) \amp = \int_c^b f(x)\, dx - \int_c^a f(x)\, dx </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp =  \int_c^b f(x)\, dx - \left( -\int_a^c f(x)\, dx\right) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = \int_c^b f(x)\, dx + \int_a^c f(x)\, dx</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = \int_a^b f(x)\, dx </mrow>
        </md>
        See that it doesn't matter where <m>c</m> is located as I didn't use the figure for this symbol-pushing proof. 
      </p>
    </solution>

  <exercises>
  <title>Part (c): Why doesn't the <m>\boldsymbol{+C}</m> matter in definite integrals? </title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Recall we always need to add the <m>+ C</m> at the end of the indefinite integrals since antiderivatives of a function isn't unique. 
        But why doesn't we need to add the <m>+ C</m> in the definite integrals when it comes to the area...  
      </p>
      <p>
        Well let's answer this question using a specific example. 
        Let's define <m>f</m> as a function such that <m>f(x) = e^x</m>. 
        The goal is to find <m>\int_1^3 e^x\, dx</m> following the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus <em>exactly</em> as follows: 
      </p>
      <ol marker="(i)">
        <li>
          <p>
            Find an antiderivative of <m>f(x) = e^x</m> and label it <m>F(x)</m>. 
            Rather than leaving the generic <m>+ C</m>, let's pick a specific <alert>non-zero</alert> value for the <m>C</m>. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find <m>F(3)</m> and <m>F(1)</m> <em>exactly</em>. 
            That is, don't put things into the calculator and get some decimals out of it. 
            The goal here is to track where the constant goes so it won't help us if the constant is being absorbed into some weird decimals. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now find <m>F(3) - F(1)</m>. 
            Observe what happens to the constant you picked while you do the subtraction.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        Now that you played with an actual example, explain <alert>why</alert> we don't need to add the <m>+C</m> when evaluating the definite integrals. 
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        We are given that <m>f(x) = e^x</m>. 
        We know that 
        <me>
          F(x) = \int e^x\, dx = e^x + C
        </me>
        Let's pick <m>C = 76,877</m>. 
        Then the antiderivative here is 
        <me>
          F(x) = e^x + 76,877
        </me>
        By the FTC, we know that
        <md>
          <mrow> \int_1^3 e^x\, dx \amp = F(3) - F(1) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = \left(e^3 + 76,877\right) - \left(e^1 + 76,877\right) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = e^3 + 76,877 - e^1 - 76,877 </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = e^3 - e^1</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        See that the constant I picked, <m>76,877</m>, is canceled in the subtraction! 
      </p>

      <p>
        To make it more generalized, you can imagine no matter what random <m>C</m> you picked for the antiderivative, it will be subtracted out! 
        <md>
          <mrow> \int_a^b f(x)\, dx \amp= \left(F(b) + C\right) - \left(F(a) + C\right) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = F(b) + C - F(a) - C </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = F(b) - F(a) </mrow>
        </md>
        No wonder why we don't put the <m>+C</m> when dealing with definite integrals! 
      </p>
