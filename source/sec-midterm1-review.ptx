  <title>Midterm Exam #1 Practice Problems</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        The first midterm exam will cover chapter 5 about the basics of integration. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Below you will find some practice problems in chapter 5. 
        Feel free to try some of the problems in preparation of the exam. 
        The answer key is also included solely for you to check your answer. 
        No peeking before you try solving some problems! 
        One illusion students sometimes hold is that they can master the math concepts by simply reading it. 
        No it won't work!
