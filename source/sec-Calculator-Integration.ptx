  <title>Does calculators evaluate integrals "smartly"?</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            There are some computer algebra system (CAS), including
            <url href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/integral-calculator">WolframAlpha</url>, 
            <url href="https://www.symbolab.com/solver/integral-calculator">Symbolab</url>, 
            <url href="https://www.integral-calculator.com/">Integral Calculator</url>, 
            and so many others, to evaluate integrals.  
        </p>
        <p>
            As we saw in the previous task, there are multiple approaches to evaluate integrals, some of which may be easier than others. 
            We know CAS is a pretty powerful tool to evaluate integrals, but does it always evaluate integrals using the most "efficient" way? 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this activity, you will compete with CAS to evaluate the following integral and see who will give the most elegant solution. 
            <me>
              \int \left(\sin x + \cos x\right)^2 \, dx
            </me>
        </p>
    </introduction>

      <title>Part (a): Evaluation by hand</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Evaluate the integral by hand. Show your work by writing down each of the step AND explain a bit the rationale behind the steps. 
          </p>
          <hint>
            <p>
                We can't split up the integral because of the square. Can we first simplify the integrant a bit? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice that we are working with trigonometric functions, and we know a lot of trigonometric identities that may be helpful to simplify the integrand... 
            </p>
          </hint>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The key identities to use here are the pythagorean identity 
            <me>
              \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1
            </me>
            and the double-angle identity
            <me>
              \sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)
            </me>
            Now let us start to evaluate this integral by hand! 
            <md>
              <mrow> \int \left(\sin x + \cos x\right)^2 \, dx \amp = \int\left(\sin^2(x) + 2\sin(x)\cos(x) + \cos^2(x)\right)\, dx </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \int\left(1 + 2\sin(x)\cos(x)\right) </mrow> 
              <mrow> \amp = \int \left(1 + \sin(2x)\right)\, dx</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = x + \frac{1}{2}\cos(2x) + C</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
        </solution>
    </exercises>

    <exercises>
      <title>Part (b): Evaluation by CAS</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Go to <url href="https://www.integral-calculator.com/">Integral Calculator</url> and input "(sinx+cosx)^2". Then click Go! 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            After the CAS evaluated the integral, scroll down on the Result and click "Show steps" to see how the CAS evaluated the integral. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Your task here is to briefly summarize the approach the CAS used to evaluate this integral (don't copy down the work exactly. Instead, <alert>summarize</alert> the process by saying what they did in each step). 
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            Well what CAS did was to expand <m>(\sin x + \cos x)^2</m> and broke it down using linearity as follows: 
            <md>
              <mrow> \int \left(\sin x + \cos x\right)^2 \amp = \int \left(\sin^2 x + 2\sin(x)\cos(x) + \cos^2(x)\right)\, dx </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \int\sin^2(x)\, dx + \int 2\sin(x)\cos(x)\, dx + \int \cos^2(x)\, dx </mrow>
            </md>
            Well the middle integral is easy to evaluate but CAS uses the reduction formula for <m>\int \sin^2(x)\, dx</m> and <m>\int \cos^2(x)\, dx</m>, making the steps a lot more complicated. 
          </p>
        </solution>
    </exercises>

    <exercises>
      <title>Part (c): Compare and Reflect</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Compare your solution with the one CAS provided. Then write a short reflection that addresses the following prompts: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In your opinion, who do you think provided an easier and more elegant solution? You or the CAS? Why? 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How does this task inform you about evaluating integrals using CAS? Can we trust it blindly? 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </statement>
    </exercises>

      Then format your work for the investigations for this week, as a <alert>single pdf file</alert> and submit it in 
      <url href="https://canvas.pdx.edu/courses/103253/assignments/1071239/">this assignment dropbox</url> 
      on Canvas. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that your work will be graded on your effort in completing the tasks and your understanding of concepts!
