  <title>Does calculators evaluate integrals "smartly"?</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            There are some computer algebra system (CAS), including
            <url href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/integral-calculator">WolframAlpha</url>, 
            <url href="https://www.symbolab.com/solver/integral-calculator">Symbolab</url>, 
            <url href="https://www.integral-calculator.com/">Integral Calculator</url>, 
            and so many others, to evaluate integrals.  
        </p>
        <p>
            As we saw in the previous task, there are multiple approaches to evaluate integrals, some of which may be easier than others. 
            We know CAS is a pretty powerful tool to evaluate integrals, but does it always evaluate integrals using the most "efficient" way? 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this activity, you will compete with CAS to evaluate the following integral and see who will give the most elegant solution. 
            <me>
              \int \left(\sin x + \cos x\right)^2 \, dx
            </me>
        </p>

      <title>Part (a): Evaluation by hand</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Evaluate the integral by hand. Write down each of your steps. 
          </p>
          <hint>
            <p>
                We can't split up the integral because of the square. Can we first simplify the integrant a bit? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice that we are working with trigonometric functions, and we know a lot of trigonometric identities that may be helpful to simplify the integrand...

      <title>Part (b): Evaluation by CAS</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Go to <url href="https://www.integral-calculator.com/">Integral Calculator</url> and input "(sinx+cosx)^2". Then click Go! 
          </p>
          <p>
            After the CAS evaluated the integral, scroll down on the Result and click "Show steps" to see how the CAS evaluated the integral. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Your task here is to briefly summarize the approach the CAS used to evaluate this integral (don't copy down the steps exactly. Instead, summarize what they did).

      <title>Part (c): Compare and Reflect</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Compare your solution with the one CAS provided. Then write a short reflection that addresses the following prompts: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In your opinion, who do you think provided an easier and more elegant solution? Why? 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </statement>
