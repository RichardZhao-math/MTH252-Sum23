  <title>Basic Trigonometric Integrals</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
        Well in order to evaluate some trigonometric integrals, we need some basic integral formulas we can use. 
        We learned some integral formulas in Chapter 5 involving trigonometric functions. 
        I included them below.

                    <mrow>\int \sin(x)\, dx = -\cos(x) + C \qquad \amp \qquad \int \cos(x)\, dx = \sin(x) + C </mrow>
                    <mrow>\int \sec^2(x)\, dx = \tan(x) + C \qquad \amp \qquad \int \csc^2(x)\, dx = -\cot(x) + C </mrow>
                    <mrow>\int \sec(x)\tan(x)\, dx = \sec(x) + C \qquad \amp \qquad \int \csc(x)\cot(x)\, dx = -\csc(x) + C </mrow>

    </theorem>

    <p>
        Remember we got this batch of formulas from calc 1. 
        We learned about the derivatives of the six trigonometric functions and we basically just rewrite those derivative formulas using integrals. 
    </p>

    <p>
        But we actually don't know about the integral formulas of all the six trigonometric functions yet... 
        The goal of this activity is to derive the integral formula of tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant.

        <alert>P.S.:</alert> To help you stay on track, I will give you the method you should use and also the answer. 
        <em>Your job is to evaluate the integral and obtain the answer in the exact format</em>.
        Don't forget to show all your work to convince Richard that you know where the formulas come from.

    <title>Part (a): Integral of (Co)Tangent</title>

    <statement>
        <p>
            Let's start by figuring out what the integral of tangent and cotangent are! 
        </p>

        <p>
            Your job is to evaluate <m>\displaystyle \int \tan(x)\, dx</m> and <m>\displaystyle \int \cot(x)\, dx</m>. 
        </p>
    </statement>

        <p>
            Since we knew nothing about the integral of tangent and cotangent, a good strategy is to convert them to sine and cosine, because we do know about the integrals (and also derivatives) of sine and cosine. 
            The following identities should be helpful to get you started: 
            <me>
                \tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \quad\text{and}\quad \cot(x) = \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}
            </me>
            The method you should be thinking about using here is <m>u</m>-sub... (so pick your <m>u</m> wisely).

            If your math is right, then you should arrive the following answers: 
            <md>
                <mrow>\int \tan(x)\, dx \amp= \ln\left|\sec(x)\right| + C </mrow>
                <mrow>\int \cot(x)\, dx \amp= \ln\left|\sin(x)\right| + C \amp </mrow>

    <title>Part (b): Integral of (Co)Secant</title>
    <p>
        Next, we will tackle the integral of secant and cosecant!
    </p>

    <p>
        Your job is to evaluate <m>\displaystyle \int \sec(x)\, dx</m> and <m>\displaystyle \int \csc(x)\, dx</m>. 
    </p>

            These two integrals are bit tricky since the previous strategy won't work well in the sense that we don't get both the <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m> in a single integral. 
            So we will need a tricky manipulation to turn <m>\sec(x)</m> and <m>\csc(x)</m> into a slightly complicated fractions to work with, and they are
            <md>
                <mrow> \sec(x) \amp= \frac{\sec(x)\big(\sec(x) + \tan(x)\big)}{\sec(x) + \tan(x)} </mrow>
                <mrow> \csc(x) \amp= \frac{\csc(x)\big(\csc(x) - \cot(x)\big)}{\csc(x) - \cot(x)}</mrow>
            </md>
            The method you should be thinking about using here is also <m>u</m>-sub (in a similar fashion to Part (a)).

    <p>
      Put the formulas to your integral formula sheet (now you have more formulas to use!). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then go to the 
      <url href="https://richardzhao-math.github.io/MTH252-Sum23/sec-Intermediate-TrigIntegral.html">next activity</url> 
      to explore the intermediate trigonometric integrals about dealing with multiple trigonometric functions in an integral.
