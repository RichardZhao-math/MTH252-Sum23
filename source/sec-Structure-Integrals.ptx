  <title>The Structure of Integrals</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the Great Gorilla Jump problem, you saw that we can figure out the total distance traveled by adding up a bunch of pieces of distance together, and we obtained each little piece of the distance by multiplying the respective velocity and the elapsed time. 
      This is exactly what an integral is, that we are adding a bunch of the pieces together obtained by multiplying something together. 
      This idea is called "<alert>Adding-up-Pieces</alert>". 
    </p>

    <p>
      In this activity, you will explain what each component in the Great Gorilla Jump problem represents and then generalize it to explore the structure of the definite integrals. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>P.S.:</alert> This idea may seem similar to the Riemann sum you learned back in section 5.2. 
      This is perfectly correct! The Adding-up-Pieces idea is like a generalized version of the Riemann sum in the sense that we don't only apply this idea to just finding the area of a bunch of rectangles or the area under the curve.

  <title>Part (a): Math up the Great Gorilla Jump Problem!   </title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's call <m>\Delta t</m> the elapsed time (and it is typically 0.5 seconds) and <m>v(t_i)</m> the velocity of the gorilla at a certain point, where <m>i</m> is the index to indicate which piece we are referring to. 
        If we call each piece of the distance <m>d_i</m>, then it can be obtained by 
        <me>
          d_i = v(t_i)\Delta t
        </me>
        You also found out that we can find the total distance by adding up the pieces together. 
        By using the fancy sigma notation you learned before, the total distance traveled is 
        <me>
          d \approx \sum_{i = 1}^N d_i = \sum_{i = 1}^N v(t_i)\, \Delta t
        </me>
        where <m>N</m> denotes the number of pieces. 
      </p>

      <p>
        We know that the approximation is better and better if we recorded more and more velocity as that will force the elapsed time to become smaller and smaller. 
        Symbolically speaking, the total distance travel can be computed by
        <me>
          d = \lim_{N\to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^N v(t_i)\, \Delta t
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let's switch our attention to the definite integrals. Hypothetically speaking let's say we knew the velocity function, <m>y = v(t)</m>. 
        Then by section 5.6, we know that the total distance traveled is
        <me>
          d = \int_0^5 v(t)\, dt
        </me>
        Note that there is no turnaround so the displacement and the distance traveled should be the same (if we are less picky about the sign). 
      </p>

      <p>
        Wow that's a long preamble..., and here is your task! We have two expressions to represent the same thing (the total distance) so we can equate them. 
        <me>
          \int_0^5 v(t)\, dt = \lim_{N\to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^N v(t_i)\, \Delta t
        </me>
        Explain what each part of the integral means using this equation. 
        To be more explicit, what does the following symbols represent. Be as specifically as possible.  
        <ul marker="">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\displaystyle \int_0^5</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>v(t)</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>dt</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>

  <title>Part (b): General Structure of Integrals</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The general structure of integrals is like the one below (you can find a similar version in our textbook in section 5.2): 
        <me>
          \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \lim_{N\to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^N f(x_i) \, \Delta x
        </me>
        From the Great Gorilla Jump problem, we got the distance by (1) multiplying, and then (2) adding. 
        By staring at the structure of a generic definite integral, <m>\int_a^b f(x)\, dt</m> ,what is it that are being multiplied and what is it that is being added? 
        Which symbol (or the lack of symbol) represents the multiplication and which symbol represents the addition? 
      </p>
    </statement>

    <p>
      Now that you have a better understanding of the structure and the meaning of the definite integrals, we can make sense of other applications of integrals easier.
