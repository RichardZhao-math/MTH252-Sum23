  <title>A Physics and Engineering Application -- Work</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      You may have heard of a measurement called <alert>work</alert> before, as it measures the transfer of energy by a force acting on an object as it is displaced. 
      In a nutshell, the work (<m>W</m>) can be computed by multiplying the force (<m>F</m>) with the displacement (<m>d</m>) together, like this
      <me>
        W = F\, d
      </me>
      Notice that we can obtain the work if we know the (constant) force applied to an object and the displacement. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But there is no guarantee that the force applied to an object remains constant for the entire duration of the displacement... 
      So the above formula is really limited in the sense that we don't know exactly what the value of <m>F</m> is (since it varies). 
      Thankfully we know calculus now and calculus will come to our rescue (calculus is a study that deals with changes)! 
    </p>

    <p>
      In this activity, your task is to explain <alert>why</alert> the calculus version of the work formula appears the way it is and apply it to an application. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>P.S.:</alert> You can find more information about the work done on an object in section 6.5 in our textbook. 
      While this isn't a required section in this class, you will definitely encounter this type of application if you are a physics and/or an engineering major.

    <title>Part (a): Why does the formula look like this? </title>
    
    <statement>
      <p>
        In most calculus textbooks (including ours), work is being defined as
        <definition xml:id="def-Work-Calculus">
          <statement>
            <p>
              The work done by a variable force <m>F</m> moving an object along a line from <m>x = a</m> to <m>x = b</m> in the direction of the force is
              <men xml:id="eqn-def-Work-Calculus">
                W = \int_a^b F(x)\, dx
              </men>
            </p>
          </statement>
        </definition>
      </p>

      <p>
        Ummm but why can we obtain the work by integrating the force... 
        Explain why this formula makes sense to your friends as if they just finished the algebra-based physics and didn't know as much calculus as you do. 
      </p>
    </statement>

    <hint>
      <p>
        It is very tempting to say that this is because the derivative of work is force. 
        But this isn't convincing in the sense that more explanation is needed to justify why the derivative of work is force (so we don't want to bring in more difficult concepts to explain). 
        Without much calculus background, this won't make sense (and it still doesn't make sense to Richard despite his excellency in math but knew practically nothing in Newtonian physics... He didn't have a great calc-based physics professor when he was a freshman in undergrad). 
      </p> 
      
      <p>
        But recall integrals is really about adding up pieces together obtained by multiplication! 
        Your friends did know about the concept of work and adding stuff together! 
      </p>
    </hint>

    <solution>
      <p>
        In this calculus version of the formula, 
        <ul marker="">
          <li>
            <p>
              the integrand is <m>F(x)</m>, which represents the force applied on an object at a certain point <m>x</m>; 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the differential <m>dx</m>, represents an infinitesimally small gap of the displacement. 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        When multiplying the <m>F(x)</m> and <m>dx</m>, we obtain one piece of the work. 
        That is, <m>F(x)\, dx</m> is a representative of one piece of the work. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The <m>\int</m> symbol tells us to add up all pieces of the work together to obtain the <alert>total</alert> work from <m>x = a</m> to <m>x = b</m>, where the initial and final values are indicated as the limits of integration. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Long story short, the calculus formula makes sense because it asked us to <em>add up</em> the <em>product</em> of force and displacement to obtain the <alert>total</alert> work from <m>x = a</m> to <m>x = b</m>. 
      </p>
    </solution>

  <title>Part (b): Put the formula to use!</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        How much work is required to move an object from <m>x = 1</m> to <m>x = 3</m>, measured in meters, in the presence of a force, measured in Newtons, <m>N</m>, given by
        <me>
          F = \frac{2}{x^2}
        </me>
        acting along the <m>x</m>-axis? 
      </p>
    </statement>

    <hint>
      <p>
        We really have two formulas here to calculate work: the short-and-easy <m>W = F\, d</m> and the slightly complicated calculus version. 
        How do we know which one we should use here... 
        Well a question that helps you decide is... Is the force in this scenario a constant during the entire displacement? 
      </p>
    </hint>

    <solution>
      <p>
        Notice that the force given is not a constant, which means the force varies. 
        Hence, we will use the calculus version of the formula (calculus is a study that deals with changes!). 
        That is, 
        <me>
          W = \int_1^3 \frac{2}{x^2}\, dx = \left(-\frac{2}{x}\right)\bigg|_1^3 = \frac{4}{3}
        </me>
        Hence, the total work required is <m>\dfrac{4}{3}</m> joules. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <alert>P.S.:</alert> The unit of work is <m>N\cdot m</m> as we literally found the work by multiplying the force and the displacement together (of course it makes sense to multiply the units too). 
        Joules (<m>J</m>) is just a short-hand notation for this composite unit of <m>N\cdot m</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun fact: the unit of force, Newton (<m>N</m>), is also a composite unit, defined as <m>kg\cdot m/s^2</m>. But this isn't a physics class so I will leave it to you to dig deeper if you are interested in knowing more physics aspect of it.
