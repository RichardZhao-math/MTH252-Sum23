  <title>The Accumulation Function</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let us first define what the accumulation function is! The definition is taken from your textbook page 326 (but your textbook call it the area function). 
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-AccumulationFunction">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a continuous function on an open interval <m>I</m> and let <m>a</m> be in <m>I</m>. We define the <alert>accumulation function</alert> as 
          <men xml:id="eqn-def-AccumulationFunction">
            A(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt
          </men>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Using our knowledge of function notations, we know that the name of the accumulation function is <m>A</m>, with the input of <m>x</m> and the output of <m>A(x)</m>. 
    </p>

  <title>Part (a): An example</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(t) = 2t - 1</m> and <m>a = 1</m>. Then we can define the accumulation function here to be 
        <me>
          A(x) = \int_1^x \left(2t - 1\right)\, dt
        </me>
        Compute <m>A(1)</m>, <m>A(2)</m>, <m>A(3)</m>, and <m>A(4)</m>. Then graph <m>y = f(t)</m> and indicate what these values represent on the graph. 
      </p>

        Julie went through a similar example in one of the lecture videos in this week. If you get stuck or you want to confirm that you are on the right track, find that example.

    <title>Part (b): Meaning of the function</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Functions have inputs and outputs. 
        What does the input of the accumulation function, <m>x</m>, represent and 
        what does the output of the accumulation function, <m>A(x)</m>, represent? 
        Be as specific as possible in your answer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After you identified the meaning of the inputs and outputs, try to come up with a reason why we call this the <alert>accumulation function</alert>? 
      </p>
    </statement>

    <!--
    <solution>
      <p>
        Notice that the variable <m>x</m> appears to be in the place of the upper limit of integration in the integral. 
        This implies that the input of the accumulation function, <m>x</m>, represents the <alert>upper limit of integration</alert>. 
        It tells us how "far" we are integrating from the starting point of <m>t = a</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The output of the accumulation function, <m>A(x)</m>, represents the <alert>signed area</alert> under the curve of <m>y = f(t)</m> from <m>t = a</m> to <m>t = x</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We call <m>A</m> the accumulation function because it <em>accumulates</em> the signed area under the curve as we move from the starting point of <m>t = a</m> to some later point <m>t = x</m>. 
      </p>
    </solution>

  <title>Part (c): Structure of the formula</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Notice that there are two variables in the accumulation function, <m>x</m> and <m>t</m>. 
        Explain why we need both <m>x</m> and <m>t</m> to define the accumulation function? 
      </p>
      <p>  
        For example, why wouldn't it make sense to define the accumulation function using ONLY <m>x</m> as the variable? 
      </p>
    </statement>
    
    <hint>
      <p>
        Let's say we define the accumulation using only <m>x</m> as the variable like this: 
        <me>
          A(x) = \int_a^x f(x)\, dx
        </me>
        Then how would we compute, let's say <m>A(2)</m>? 
        Well, we will need to replace ALL the <m>x</m>'s with <m>2</m>... 
        Does the expression make sense then?
      </p>
    </hint>
    
    <!--
    <solution>
      <p>
        The short answer is that <m>x</m> and <m>t</m> do two <em>different</em> jobs since there are two types of functions here: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>x</m> is the input variable of the accumulation function, which represents the upper limit of integration of the integral. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>t</m> is just a <em>dummy variable</em> we use to represent the input of the function <m>f</m>. 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression wouldn't make sense 
      </p>
