  <title>Week 5 Activities</title>

  <introduction>
    
    <p> 
      The activities for this week will ask you to think about integrals in a different way. 
      Recall the two major ways you think about integrals so far are: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Some signed area under the curve, and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Some general antiderivative of the integrand, plug some numbers in, and do the subtraction. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Well it turns out that neither of them are the <alert>actual</alert> meaning of integrals. 
      The area aspect is a <alert>graphical</alert> interpretation of integrals and the antiderivative is just one <alert>method</alert> to evaluate integrals, guaranteed by the FTC. 
      These two approaches are limited when applying integrals to real-world problems since (1) we don't always have a graph to work with, and (2) not all functions will have a nice antiderivatives we can work with. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There are three goals for the activities this week: 
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Investigate the actual meaning of integrals through the famous gorilla problem. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Analyze the meaning and the structure of integrals through the application and generalize it. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Apply the actual meaning of integrals to another application commonly used in physics and engineering. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are ready to investigate the actual meaning of integrals, click the buttons below and work through the tasks following the prompts. 
      You are more than welcome to work with your classmates collaboratively but you will need to write up your own work. 
      When you completed all the tasks, format your work into a <alert>single pdf file</alert> and submit it in the corresponding assignment dropbox on Canvas.
