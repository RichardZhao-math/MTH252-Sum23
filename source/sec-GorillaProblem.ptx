  <title>The Great Gorilla Jump</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Imagine this: a gorilla, suited up with a parachute, climbs to the top of a tall city building as part of a special wildlife training experiment. 
      After a brief moment of hesitation, the gorilla bravely leaps off the edge. 
      As the parachute deploys and air resistance kicks in, you, as one of the researchers on the ground, begin recording data to study how the gorilla's velocity changes over time.
      Using high-speed sensors, the team records the gorillaâ€™s downward velocity every half-second as it falls. 
      Note that the gorilla touched the ground just after 5 seconds. 
      The recorded data is shown below.

  <title>Part (a): How far did the gorilla travel? </title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Recall we can find the distance by <alert>multiplying</alert> the elapsed time and the velocity during the time. 
        The formula is 
        <me>
            \text{distance} = \text{time}\times\text{velocity}
        </me>
        We are given a bunch of data points so let's find the total distance traveled as follows:

        (2) Approximate the <alert>total</alert> distance the gorilla fell from the time he jumped off the building until the time he landed on the ground. 
      </p>
    </statement>

    <hint>
      <p>
        To figure out the distance, we need to know the elapsed time and the velocity during the time. 
        The length of the elapsed time should be clear (hopefully). 
        Yet the velocity isn't... 
        Can we pick a (reasonable) velocity to <em>approximate</em> the distance? 
      </p>
      <p>
        By saying approximating the distance, there is no one right answer.
        Just make sure your approximation is reasonable.

  <exercises>
  <title>Part (b): How to make the approximation better?  </title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The assumption in part (a) here is that the distance traveled you computed is an approximation, not the <em>exact</em> distance traveled. 
        There are two issues to address and your part (b) is to address these two issues: 
        <ol marker="(1)">
          <li>
            <p>
              Briefly describe <alert>why</alert> the result you got in part (a) is indeed an approximation. 
              That is, how do you know the answer you got isn't the <em>exact</em> distance traveled. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              How can you make the approximation better? 
              What changes could you make to the way you collect the data to make the approximation better? 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>

    <hint>
      <p>
        Think about the gravitational acceleration. Since the gorilla fell on the planet of earth, the acceleration remains a constant of 32 feet per second. 
        What does it mean to the velocity? 
        Does it make sense for the velocity to stay constant for 0.5 of a second?

    <title>When you complete the tasks... </title>
    <p>
      You may be wondering how a gorilla falling is relevant to the integrals. 
      A quick connection we can draw here is that the (indefinite) integral of velocity represents some sort of displacement. 
      Since there is no turnaround in the motion, the distance traveled is the displacement (if you go easy on the sign). 
      You will explore the connection in the next activity.
