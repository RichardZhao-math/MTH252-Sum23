  <title>Justifying THE Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</title>

  <p>
    It turns out that THE fundamental theorem of calculus says the integration and differentiation are inverse operation. 
    That is, they will cancel each other. 
    This relation (at least half of it) is captured in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part II, in your textbook page 326.
