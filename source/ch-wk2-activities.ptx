  <title>Week 2 Activities</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      The activities for this week will ask you to investigate the <alert>accumulation function</alert> (or your textbook call it the area function). 
    </p>

    <p>
      We will be using this function to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus next week so make sure you understand what this function does (i.e., what do the inputs and the outputs represent) as well as the structure of the formula. 
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are ready to investigate further on the accumulation function, click the button below and work through the tasks following the prompts. 
      When you complete all the tasks, format your work into a <alert>single pdf file</alert> and submit it in the corresponding assignment dropbox on Canvas. 
    </p>
