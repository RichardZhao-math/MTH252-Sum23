  "body": " The Accumulation Function   Let us first define what the accumulation function is! The definition is taken from your textbook page 326 (but your textbook call it the area function).    Let be a continuous function on an open interval and let be in . We define the accumulation function as     Using our knowledge of function notations, we know that the name of the accumulation function is , with the input of and the output of .    Part (a): An example   Let and . Then we can define the accumulation function here to be Compute , , , and . Then graph and indicate what these values represent on the graph.    Julie went through a similar example in one of the lecture videos in this week. If you get stuck or you want to confirm that you are on the right track, find that example.

The Diagram of         Part (b): Meaning of the function   Functions have inputs and outputs. What does the input of the accumulation function, , represent and what does the output of the accumulation function, , represent? Be as specific as possible in your answer.  After you identified the meaning of the inputs and outputs, try to come up with a reason why we call this the accumulation function ?    Notice that the variable appears to be in the place of the upper limit of integration in the integral. This implies that the input of the accumulation function, , represents the upper limit of integration . It tells us how \"far\" we are integrating from the starting point of .  The output of the accumulation function, , represents the signed area under the curve of from to .  We call the accumulation function because it accumulates the signed area under the curve as we move from the starting point of to some later point . To make it more generalized, the accumulation function accumulates some quantity (and it doesn't have to be some area) between two points. We will look at a more generalized version of integrals in week 5 investigation.     Part (c): Structure of the formula   Notice that there are two variables in the accumulation function, and . Explain why we need both and to define the accumulation function?  For example, why wouldn't it make sense to define the accumulation function using ONLY as the variable?    Let's say we define the accumulation using only as the variable like this: Then how would we compute, let's say ? Well, we will need to replace ALL the 's with ... Does the expression make sense then?    The short answer is that and do two different jobs since there are two types of functions here:    is the input variable of the accumulation function, which represents the upper limit of integration of the integral.     is just a dummy variable we use to represent the input of the function .     If we define the accumulation function only using as an variable like Then the expression wouldn't make sense since it is impossible to evaluate this function.  As an example, would be Well... is a constant (the output of the function with an input of 2) so we are really integrating a number here (boring). Also, what is ... Well we know that the symbol here represents the infinitesimally small amount of change. But 2 is a constant and the value of 2 will never change... So doesn't really make sense mathematically.

  "title": "Justifying THE Fundamental Theorem of Calculus",
  "body": " Justifying THE Fundamental Theorem of Calculus   It turns out that THE fundamental theorem of calculus says the integration and differentiation are inverse processes. That is, they will cancel each other. This relation (at least half of it) is captured in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part II, in your textbook page 326. I also included it below:   The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus   Let be a continuous function on an open interval and let be in . Then the definite integral of from to , aka the accumulation function, is an antiderivative of on . That is, Equivalently,     You may be wondering why differentiation will cancel the integration. Well your textbook provided a technical proof in this section using the fancy Squeeze Theorem. In this investigation, we will explore the (same) proof but in a more intuitive sense.   P.S.: If you get stuck, feel free to find the technical proof in the textbook for inspiration (or ask Richard for help\/hint).    Part (a): Starting Point - Set up the Expression   Since the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus involved some derivatives, so let's do a quick review on what derivatives represents!  Recall that derivatives represent the instantaneous rate of change of some function at a specific value, and we can find the instantaneous rate of change by taking the limit of the average rate of change of a function as the gap between the values are going to 0.  Set up an expression to represent by (1) first setting up a fraction to represent the average rate of change of the function (which function), and then (2) taking the limit of the fraction as the gap of the values approaches 0.   P.S.: I included some hints below to help you get started, as a good setup is important for the next two parts of the investigation. If you need help or have questions, make sure to reach out to Richard. Feel free to reach out to him too if you just want to confirm that you have the right setup.    If you need help on the symbolic definition of derivatives...  Below is the definition of derivative:   Let be a function differentiable at . Then the derivative of , denoted as , is defined by        If you need help on picking the function...  Recall there are two functions involved, the accumulation function, , and another function under which we are finding the area, . Based on the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which function are we taking the derivative of, or ?    The function we are taking the derivative of in the theorem is the accumulation function, . Then we can set up the expression by applying the limit definition of derivatives to the function as follows. Recall that the fraction, without the limit symbol, represents the average rate of change of the area under the curve from to . By taking the limit of the average rate of change as the gap from to approaches 0, we obtain the instantaneous rate of change, aka the derivative.     Part (b): Average Rate of Change of the Area   Let's focus on the average rate of change of the area. I coded a pretty picture below to help you visual the situation.       Simplify the fraction representing the average rate of change from to you came up with in part (a). Keep in mind that the goal for part (c) is to find the instantaneous rate of change so feel free to assume here is a small number.    If you need help on sorting out different area components...  Part of your expression in part (a) should contain something like and . What do they represent, in terms of color, in the graph provided?  Again, part of your expression in part (a) should contain something like . Which color in the graph represent this expression and how can we rewrite it using ONE definite integral?    If you need help on approximating the area of interest...  We learned some cool methods to approximate area under the curve in section 5.1. Let's use one of them to approximate the area of interest.  But... how many rectangles should I split up the area to? Recall that we assume is a very small number. That means using ONE skinny rectangle should suffice to apprixomate the area since is super very really small.  Also... which approximation method from section 5.1 should I use here... left-endpoint or right-endpoint approximation? Well Richard would say just pick one, following your heart.    Now let's focus on simplifying the average rate of change,   By looking at the pretty figure, we observe that    represents the total area of the green and orange region.     represents the area of the green region.   This implies that should give us the area of the orange region. Remember that is a super very really small number, so the orange region should be a super skinny strip whose area can approximated using a rectangle.  Recall the fancy left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximation we learned back in section 5.1? They seem like great methods to approximate the area of the skinny orange strip. The width of the orange strip is and the height is either or depending on which method you picked. It turns out it doesn't matter which one you picked as the height since is super very really small anyway. For demonstration, I will pick as the height of the orange strip. Then the average rate of change of the area is      Part (c): Instantaneous Rate of Change of the Area   Now that you have figured out the average rate of change of the area under the curve, what is the instantaneous rate of change (aka the derivative) of the accumulation function?  That is, what is the limit of the average rate of change you found in part (b) as approaches 0.    If you need help on evaluating the limit...  You should have an integral-free expression by now since you \"approximated\" the area using a skinny rectangle in part (b). Now that we have an expression to work with, what is the very first step you should do to evaluate the limit that your calculus 1 instructor told you, especially if you took calculus 1 with me.   If you play your cards right, the limit of the average rate of change, aka the derivative of the accumulation function, should be . What!!?? Differentiation undo the integration indeed!   Now that we figured out the average rate of change, the derivative is just the limit of the average rate of change we found in part (b) as approaches 0. That is, We proved it!    Julie also proved the FTC in one of her lecture videos. Feel free to check it out if you are more of a visual person!  Here is the video: https:\/\/media.pdx.edu\/media\/t\/1_82n44iqx    When you complete the tasks...  Take a break and celebrate that you worked through all the complicated symbols and proved the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus!  Then continue to the next assignment this week by exploring the proof of the corollary of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which is the big theorem in section 5.4 that you will be using again and again and again in this class!

  "title": "Justifying An Corollary of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus",
  "body": " Justifying An Corollary of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus   Well the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part II, isn't the theorem we use a lot. Instead, we use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part I, a lot to help us evaluate definite integrals. This is actually a (most useful) corollary of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The theorem is presented in your textbook page 318. I also included it below:    Assume that and that is continuous on . If is an antiderivative of on , then     Julie (and your textbook) provided a proof to this corollary by using the mean value theorem. We will approach things differently by proving this result using the accmulation function and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus you proved in the previous investigation.   P.S.: The tasks below seem long but they are mostly procedures to follow. The goal here is to convince you the facts in each part are true.    Part (a): How \"different\" are all the antiderivatives of a function?   Let's take a step back a bit to section 5.3 about antiderivatives now. Recall the antiderivative of a function isn't unique (so a function can have a gazillon of different antiderivatives). But how different are the antiderivatives of a function?  Well we know the answer: All the antiderivatives of a function should differ by a constant ! This fact is being captured by the theorem in your textbook page 310 (I also included it below).   The General Antiderivative   Let be an antiderivative of on . Then every antiderivative on is of the form of for some constant .    This is also the reason why we always need to stick a everytime we find the indefinite integrals since the indefinite integral of a function is defined as its general antiderivative.  Your job in this part is to explain why all antiderivatives of a function only differ by a constant.    If you need help on the steps of the proof...  Well your textbook includes the proof for sure. Yet, your textbook simply quoted the mean value theorem. Try to explain what is really going mathematically rather than simply quoting the MVT. I also broke down the proof into the following steps for you to follow.    Since we want to figure out how different the antiderivatives of a function are, let's pick two arbitrary antiderivative of a function, called and .    Well we want to find the difference of them, so let's subtract them and name the difference . That is, we define .    What do we know about the difference, ? Well one thing we know is the derivative of for sure. Richard claimed that ... Why so?    Put on your calculus 1 thinking cap! What type of function will have the derivative of ? This will help you wrap up the argument.      The whole idea of this argument relies on the fact that only constants will give the derivative of 0.  To make the argument more rigorous, we will let and be some antiderivative of the same function . That is, and .  Since we care about the difference of them, let's define their difference to be where .  We can certainly take the derivative of ! By the linearity, we have So we know the derivative of the difference is 0.  What do we know about the type of function whose derivative is 0... Well from calculus 1, we know that (only) constant functions will have the derivative of 0. That is, for some random constant .  Putting everything together, we know that , which implies that .  Now you see where the comes from!     Part (b): Prove the Corollary of the FTC   Let be a continuous function on . By , it seems like the theorem works with any antiderivative of . Well, we proved in the first investigation this week that the accumulation function, , is an antiderivative! So the theorem should work if we use in replace of in the theorem. We will prove instead and the actual proof will just be slightly different (but the idea remains!).  I will again code a pretty picture below to help you visualize the situation:       See that there is another value, , on the -axis. Symbolically speaking, it doesn't matter where is located but let's put it to the left of .  The reason why we needed an additional value of here is to work with the accumulation function. Let's quickly (re)define the accumulation function slightly bit different (simply because is being taken for something else).   Now your job in this part is to argue why the following equation is true by answering the following sub-questions:   Which area in the picture, in terms of color, is represented by . What about and ?    Rewrite using ONE definite integral. Then rewrite using another definite integral. Be careful about the limits of integration for both integrals.    Now simplify by condensing it to ONE single integral. If you play your cards right, the answer will be since the colors should match.       If you need help on condensing the integrals...  In the lecture video of section 5.2, Julie went through a couple properties of definite integrals. You will need two of them to condense the two definite integrals into . They are and Well the , , and represent different things so you probably want to sort out the symbols a bit.    Using the definition of the accumulation function in the prompt, we know that Using the properties of definite integrals, we have See that it doesn't matter where is located as I didn't use the figure for this symbol-pushing proof.     Part (c): Why doesn't the matter in definite integrals?   Recall we always need to add the at the end of the indefinite integrals since antiderivatives of a function isn't unique. But why doesn't we need to add the in the definite integrals when it comes to the area...  Well let's answer this question using a specific example. Let's define as a function such that . The goal is to find following the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus exactly as follows:    Find an antiderivative of and label it . Rather than leaving the generic , let's pick a specific non-zero value for the .    Find and  exactly . That is, don't put things into the calculator and get some decimals out of it. The goal here is to track where the constant goes so it won't help us if the constant is being absorbed into some weird decimals.    Now find . Observe what happens to the constant you picked while you do the subtraction.    Now that you played with an actual example, explain why we don't need to add the when evaluating the definite integrals.    We are given that . We know that Let's pick . Then the antiderivative here is By the FTC, we know that   See that the constant I picked, , is canceled in the subtraction!  To make it more generalized, you can imagine no matter what random you picked for the antiderivative, it will be subtracted out! No wonder why we don't put the when dealing with definite integrals!     When you complete the tasks...  Format your work for this investigation, together with the previous assignment in this week, as a single pdf file and submit it in this assignment dropbox on Canvas.

  "title": "The Great Gorilla Jump",
  "body": " The Great Gorilla Jump   Imagine this: a gorilla, suited up with a parachute, climbs to the top of a tall city building as part of a special wildlife training experiment. After a brief moment of hesitation, the gorilla bravely leaps off the edge. As the parachute deploys and air resistance kicks in, you, as one of the researchers on the ground, begin recording data to study how the gorilla's velocity changes over time. Using high-speed sensors, the team records the gorilla’s downward velocity every half-second as it falls. Note that the gorilla touched the ground just after 5 seconds. The recorded data is shown below.    Time (in seconds)  Velocity (in feet per second)    0  0    0.5  5    1.0  7    1.5  8    2.0  11    2.5  11.5    3.0  12    3.5  13    4.0  15.5    4.5  18    5.0  19        Part (a): How far did the gorilla travel?   Recall we can find the distance by multiplying the elapsed time and the velocity during the time. The formula is We are given a bunch of data points so let's find the total distance traveled as follows:  (1) Approximate how far the gorilla fell during each half-second interval and fill in the table below.      Time (in seconds)  Approximate distance traveled (in feet)    0 -- 0.5     0.5 -- 1.0     1.0 -- 1.5     1.5 -- 2.0     2.0 -- 2.5     2.5 -- 3.0     3.0 -- 3.5     3.5 -- 4.0     4.0 -- 4.5     4.5 -- 5.0       (2) Approximate the total distance the gorilla fell from the time he jumped off the building until the time he landed on the ground.    To figure out the distance, we need to know the elapsed time and the velocity during the time. The length of the elapsed time should be clear (hopefully). Yet the velocity isn't... Can we pick a (reasonable) velocity to approximate the distance?  By saying approximating the distance, there is no one right answer. Just make sure your approximation is reasonable.    (1) There are multiple ways to approximate the distance as long as you can make an argument that the velocity you picked for each time interval is reasonable. For demonstration purposes, I will approximate the distance using the left-endpoint approximation .      Time  Approximate distance    0 -- 0.5     0.5 -- 1.0     1.0 -- 1.5     1.5 -- 2.0     2.0 -- 2.5     2.5 -- 3.0     3.0 -- 3.5     3.5 -- 4.0     4.0 -- 4.5     4.5 -- 5.0       (2) To find the total distance traveled, we just add up all the pieces of distance we found in part (1) together.    P.S.: There is no \"right\" answer to an approximation. The only difference between answers are how good the approximation is.     Part (b): How to make the approximation better?   The assumption in part (a) here is that the distance traveled you computed is an approximation, not the exact distance traveled. There are two issues to address and your part (b) is to address these two issues:   Briefly describe why the result you got in part (a) is indeed an approximation. That is, how do you know the answer you got isn't the exact distance traveled.    How can you make the approximation better? What changes could you make to the way you collect the data to make the approximation better?       Think about the gravitational acceleration. Since the gorilla fell on the planet of earth, the acceleration remains a constant of 32 feet per second. What does it mean to the velocity? Does it make sense for the velocity to stay constant for 0.5 of a second?       We know our answer is indeed an approximation because of the fact that the velocity of the gorilla falling is accelerating, thanks to gravity. That is, it is impossible for the velocity to maintain a constant within each 0.5-second interval. Yet we computed the distance by pretending the velocity within each 0.5-second interval remains a constant (so that we can actually multiply this value by the elapsed time). Hence, the answer we got is an approximation, not the exact value.    While it is (highly) unlikely for the velocity to remain constant within a fixed interval of time, it is more and more likely for the velocity to stay constant when the elapsed time is smaller and smaller. That is, to make our approximation better, we want to record more and more data on the velocity, which forces the elapsed time to be smaller and smaller (for example, as opposed to recording the velocity every 0.5 seconds, recording the velocity every 0.1 seconds will make our approximation better).        When you complete the tasks...  You may be wondering how a gorilla falling is relevant to the integrals. A quick connection we can draw here is that the (indefinite) integral of velocity represents some sort of displacement. Since there is no turnaround in the motion, the distance traveled is the displacement (if you go easy on the sign). You will explore the connection in the next activity.  Go to the next activity and explore the structure of integrals using this gorilla falling scenario!   "

  "body": " The Structure of Integrals   In the Great Gorilla Jump problem, you saw that we can figure out the total distance traveled by adding up a bunch of pieces of distance together, and we obtained each little piece of the distance by multiplying the respective velocity and the elapsed time. This is exactly what an integral is, that we are adding a bunch of the pieces together obtained by multiplying something together. This idea is called \" Adding-up-Pieces \".  In this activity, you will explain what each component in the Great Gorilla Jump problem represents and then generalize it to explore the structure of the definite integrals.   P.S.: This idea may seem similar to the Riemann sum you learned back in section 5.2. This is perfectly correct! The Adding-up-Pieces idea is like a generalized version of the Riemann sum in the sense that we don't only apply this idea to just finding the area of a bunch of rectangles or the area under the curve.    Part (a): Math up the Great Gorilla Jump Problem!   Let's call the elapsed time (and it is typically 0.5 seconds) and the velocity of the gorilla at a certain point, where is the index to indicate which piece we are referring to. If we call each piece of the distance , then it can be obtained by You also found out that we can find the total distance by adding up the pieces together. By using the fancy sigma notation you learned before, the total distance traveled is where denotes the number of pieces.  We know that the approximation is better and better if we recorded more and more velocity as that will force the elapsed time to become smaller and smaller. Symbolically speaking, the total distance travel can be computed by   Now let's switch our attention to the definite integrals. Hypothetically speaking let's say we knew the velocity function, . Then by section 5.6, we know that the total distance traveled is Note that there is no turnaround so the displacement and the distance traveled should be the same (if we are less picky about the sign).  Wow that's a long preamble..., and here is your task! We have two expressions to represent the same thing (the total distance) so we can equate them. Explain what each part of the integral means using this equation. To be more explicit, what does the following symbols represent. Be as specifically as possible.                     The symbol \" \" is just a fancy cursive S that represents Summation . The and the are the initial and the final value of the time in this context.  The here denotes the velocity of the gorilla at a certain timestamp .  The here represents the elapsed time where the gap is infinitesimal small (so is just a fancy way of representing as the gap approaches ).  The is a representative of one piece of the distance (we multiplied the velocity at time with the elapsed time ), and the symbol tells us to add all the pieces of distance together to obtain the total distance traveled.     Part (b): General Structure of Integrals   The general structure of integrals is like the one below (you can find a similar version in our textbook in section 5.2): From the Great Gorilla Jump problem, we got the distance by (1) multiplying, and then (2) adding. By staring at the structure of a generic definite integral, ,what is it that are being multiplied and what is it that is being added? Which symbol (or the lack of symbol) represents the multiplication and which symbol represents the addition?    Similar to the gorilla problem, we multiply the integrand with the differential together. That is, we multiply with . The lack of symbol between these two things represent multiplication (this is the juxtaposition in math, that the lack of symbols between two things represents multiplication).  After the multiplication, the represent one piece of the quantity we are looking for. The integral symbol, , is telling us to add all of the pieces together, while the limits of integrations, and , tells us where to start and where to end.  This is essentially what integration means, that we are adding up infinitely many pieces together, where each piece is obtained by multiplying two quantities together.     When you complete the tasks...  Now that you have a better understanding of the structure and the meaning of the definite integrals, we can make sense of other applications of integrals easier.  Go to the next activity and explore a famous application of integration in physics and engineering.   "

  "title": "A Physics and Engineering Application -- Work",
  "body": " A Physics and Engineering Application -- Work   You may have heard of a measurement called work before, as it measures the transfer of energy by a force acting on an object as it is displaced. In a nutshell, the work ( ) can be computed by multiplying the force ( ) with the displacement ( ) together, like this Notice that we can obtain the work if we know the (constant) force applied to an object and the displacement.  But there is no guarantee that the force applied to an object remains constant for the entire duration of the displacement... So the above formula is really limited in the sense that we don't know exactly what the value of is (since it varies). Thankfully we know calculus now and calculus will come to our rescue (calculus is a study that deals with changes)!  In this activity, your task is to explain why the calculus version of the work formula appears the way it is and apply it to an application.   P.S.: You can find more information about the work done on an object in section 6.5 in our textbook. While this isn't a required section in this class, you will definitely encounter this type of application if you are a physics and\/or an engineering major.    Part (a): Why does the formula look like this?   In most calculus textbooks (including ours), work is being defined as   The work done by a variable force moving an object along a line from to in the direction of the force is      Ummm but why can we obtain the work by integrating the force... Explain why this formula makes sense to your friends as if they just finished the algebra-based physics and didn't know as much calculus as you do.    It is very tempting to say that this is because the derivative of work is force. But this isn't convincing in the sense that more explanation is needed to justify why the derivative of work is force (so we don't want to bring in more difficult concepts to explain). Without much calculus background, this won't make sense (and it still doesn't make sense to Richard despite his excellency in math but knew practically nothing in Newtonian physics... He didn't have a great calc-based physics professor when he was a freshman in undergrad).  But recall integrals is really about adding up pieces together obtained by multiplication! Your friends did know about the concept of work and adding stuff together!    In this calculus version of the formula,   the integrand is , which represents the force applied on an object at a certain point ;    the differential , represents an infinitesimally small gap of the displacement.   When multiplying the and , we obtain one piece of the work. That is, is a representative of one piece of the work.  The symbol tells us to add up all pieces of the work together to obtain the total work from to , where the initial and final values are indicated as the limits of integration.  Long story short, the calculus formula makes sense because it asked us to add up the product of force and displacement to obtain the total work from to .     Part (b): Put the formula to use!   How much work is required to move an object from to , measured in meters, in the presence of a force, measured in Newtons, , given by acting along the -axis?    We really have two formulas here to calculate work: the short-and-easy and the slightly complicated calculus version. How do we know which one we should use here... Well a question that helps you decide is... Is the force in this scenario a constant during the entire displacement?    Notice that the force given is not a constant, which means the force varies. Hence, we will use the calculus version of the formula (calculus is a study that deals with changes!). That is, Hence, the total work required is joules.   P.S.: The unit of work is as we literally found the work by multiplying the force and the displacement together (of course it makes sense to multiply the units too). Joules ( ) is just a short-hand notation for this composite unit of .  Fun fact: the unit of force, Newton ( ), is also a composite unit, defined as . But this isn't a physics class so I will leave it to you to dig deeper if you are interested in knowing more physics aspect of it.     When you complete the tasks...

We learned some integral formulas in Chapter 5 involving trigonometric functions. I included them below.   Basic Trigonometric Integrals        Remember we got this batch of formulas from calc 1. We learned about the derivatives of the six trigonometric functions and we basically just rewrite those derivative formulas using integrals.  But we actually don't know about the integral formulas of all the six trigonometric functions yet... The goal of this activity is to derive the integral formula of tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant.   P.S.: To help you stay on track, I will give you the method you should use and also the answer. Your job is to evaluate the integral and obtain the answer in the exact format . Don't forget to show all your work to convince Richard that you know where the formulas come from.    Part (a): Integral of (Co)Tangent   Let's start by figuring out what the integral of tangent and cotangent are!  Your job is to evaluate and .    to help you get started...  Since we knew nothing about the integral of tangent and cotangent, a good strategy is to convert them to sine and cosine, because we do know about the integrals (and also derivatives) of sine and cosine. The following identities should be helpful to get you started: The method you should be thinking about using here is -sub... (so pick your wisely).    to check your answers...

Your job is to evaluate and .   to help you get started...  These two integrals are bit tricky since the previous strategy won't work well in the sense that we don't get both the and in a single integral. So we will need a tricky manipulation to turn and into a slightly complicated fractions to work with, and they are The method you should be thinking about using here is also -sub (in a similar fashion to Part (a)).    to check your answers...  If your math is right, then you should arrive the following answers:     Let's integrate first! Using the hint, we know that   Let . Then . This implies that   Now let's integrate !

What if there are two trigonometric functions in the integrand?  Back in MTH 112Z in which you learned a lot of the fun trigonometric identities, remember we can turn all the trigonometric functions in some combinations of and . Because of this, we will focus our investigation to some combinations of and . If you ever need to deal with other trigonometric integrals, then converting everything to some combinations of and is always a strategy to consider.  The goal of the following tasks is to develop a strategy to deal with integrals in the form of where and are some integer powers. It turns out that the parity of and will help us in determining the strategy to use.   P.S.: This is essentially what a third of section 7.2 is about. To have you explore the various strategies, your job is to take the following specific integrals while summarizing the patterns (but you don't need to include the patterns in your writeup. This will be too much). Richard will give out the strategies after the due date (so he won't take the fun of discovering some fancy math away from you). Make sure to check this page again after the due date!    Part (a): If is an odd number...   The first case we are looking at here is when the power on is an odd number. To have you explore the strategy using a specific example, your job here is to evaluate the following integral   Remember to show your work!    to help you get started...  It is kind of annoying to deal with two different trigonometric functions. The goal here is to convert them into one function (so either trying to convert as many as the 's to 's or vice versa so we only need to deal with one single trigonometric function).  The identity that may come in handy is the Pythagorean Identity, as follows:   Well but that brings up another question: Do we convert the 's to 's or the other way around...   to help you pick in which way of the conversion will help...  It turns out that both ways will work, but one way will be easier than the other one ... Let's follow the easier route to convert as many of the 's to 's as possible. That is, we want less than 3 copies of 's in the integrand.     to check your setup...  Since we want to convert as many of the 's to 's, we can use the Pythagorean identity to obtain the following integrals    P.S.: Just because Richard is nice to give you a step for you to check your work, it doesn't mean you get to start here. Show your work. How does it go from the original integral to this one?   if you need help to go further...  You actually can evaluate this integral using -sub. Try using and see how easy the integral will become!     By the hint, we want to convert as many 's to 's. Using the Pythagorean identity , we obtain Now let's use the hint Richard gave by letting . Then . This implies that      Part (b): If is an odd number...   The second case is when the power on is an odd number. It turns out that the procedure is (highly?) similar to the one in part (a) but you will need to make some adjustments since is the one with the odd power now.  Your job here is to evaluate the following integral by mimicking what you did in part (a). Again, remember to show your work!  Richard will not give out formal hints here since the hints will be highly similar to the ones above. If you get stuck or want to confirm your work, email your questions\/work to Richard and he can help you out.    Let's mimic the process here. Observe that is the one with the odd power. Then we will convert as many of the 's to 's using the Pythagorean identity. Now let . Then . This implies that      Why do we care so much about the odd power...   From the previous two examples, we can see that we can always peel out a single or from the odd power and make it part of the . For the rest of the even number of factors, we can turn it to the other one using the Pythagorean identity. To summarize it into a pretty table, these are the strategies we should consider:        Strategy    is odd   Factor out a  Convert the remaining even power of to using the Pythagorean identity  Then use -sub that      is odd   Factor out a  Convert the remaining even power of to using the Pythagorean identity  Then use -sub that        But Richard... what happens if both and are odd... Well then you can just pick one of the two strategies above and they should both work.   But Richard... what happens if neither nor are odd... Well then we need to use power-reducing formulas to chip away the power. You will explore a similar question in the next investigation. Long story short, the two major power-reducing formulas we are using are and      When you complete the tasks...  Try to see if you can summarize the pattern out of it (for example, why do we split up the cases based on which one, or has the odd power). Remember you don't need to include the pattern you summarize in the writeup and check back here after the due date to see the formal explanation.  Then go to the next activity to explore an advanced trigonometric integrals about dealing with higher powers trigonometric functions in an integral.   "

For this activity, you will explore a particular advanced method to evaluate the integral of higher power of (or ). That is, we want to evaluate integrals like where and are larger numbers (without having another trigonometric function that allows you to -sub it).  By saying an \"advanced\" method, I don't mean the math concept is advanced, but more like the algebraic work is a bit complicated (so the steps are a bit longer). In fact, I will (eventually) just give you the formula and let you use it (the proof of the formula is in your textbook).  For demonstration purposes, we will only focus on integrating the powers of in the following tasks. Remember that the method in integrating the powers of is (highly) similar!    Part (a): Base case: when the power is 2 and 3  The base case consists of the following two integrals: Your job is to evaluate these two integrals. Again, show your work!   to help you get started in the second integral...  The second integral is actually the easier one since we can use the same method to evaluate this integral from the last activity!   (Observe that the power on is odd!)   So a good first step is to convert as many of the 's to 's, following the method used in part (a) of the previous activity...   to check your setup...  The correct setup should be something like      to help you get started in the first integral...  The first integral is actually a harder one (well it depends on if you are familiar with a specific formula in MTH 112Z...). Observe that the square is what prevented us from applying any of the basic trigonometric integral formulas. Then is there a way to get rid of the square?   Yes there is! Recall we learned some special formulas in MTH 112Z called the power reducing formula . The one we want to use here is the power reducing formula for sine, as follows: See that there is no more square on your trigonometric function!    Let's start with the second integral since we have used the same method in the previous investigation task. Using the Pythagorean identity, we obtain Let . Then . This implies that   Now let's tackle the more difficult one. Using the power-reducing formula, we obtain We can integrate by a simple -sub of letting . Then we have      Part (b): Reduction Formulas for larger powers  The first integral in part (a) demonstrates the essence of integrating trigonometric functions with larger powers, that we want to reduce the power to a number small enough that we can just use one of the existing formulas (like power of 1, 2, and 3 of ).  But how do we reduce the power? There is a reduction formula for sine that we can use directly and I included it below: If you are comparing the two integrals in the above formula, we can reduce the power of in the integrand by 2 each time we apply this formula.  If you are wondering how we obtain this formula, the proof is included in section 7.1 in your textbook (I used to have my students prove the cosine version by mimicking the process but this would make this weekly investigation assignment way too long...). To get the best out of this formula, I want to make sure you know how to use it.  Your job in this part is to evaluate the following integral using this reduction formula above.   We can use the reduction formula with to integrate as follows: See that the resulting integral is something we have evaluated in part (a), so we can use the result directly. This implies that      When you complete the tasks...  Clap for yourself and celebrate that you knew the major strategies to evaluate trigonometric integrals! This will help you evaluate integrals using the method of trigonometric substitution!

  "body": " What's the \"best\" way to evaluate integrals?   Back in the 1990s, an instructor placed the following integral question at the beginning of a final exam in an integral calculus course:  Imagine you were a student taking this exam, how would you try evaluating this integral?     Part (a): First approach   What is the first method you would try to evaluate this integral? Clearly state your reasoning for choosing this method as your first approach. Then carry out the integration using this method and show all steps clearly.   P.S.: The goal isn't to figure out the answer, but to determine what your go-to method is to evaluate this integral. So be honest to yourself and stick with your first choice. If it will work out, great! If not, just try to make as much progress as possible.     Part (b): Alternative approach   Now, come up with a different method that could also be used to evaluate the same integral. Briefly explain why you believe this alternative method is valid and likely to succeed. Then, evaluate the integral using this second method, again showing all steps clearly.     Part (c): Compare and reflect  When you complete the above tasks, expand the solution below and check your answer.   Don't peek until you have finished the first two parts!  We can evaluate this integral using three methods we have learned in this class: they are -sub, trig sub, and partial fraction decomposition.     Using -sub: Let . Then . Hence, we obtain      Using Trig sub: Let . Then . Hence, we obtain   where .     Using Partial Fraction: Let and be two numbers. Note that   This implies that   We can determine that and . Hence, we obtain       Grade your work, out of 10 for each part, using the solution provided above. Then write a short reflection that addresses the following prompts:   The instructor put this integral question in the beginning of the final exam, hoping to bolster students' confidence. Do you think their goal is well accomplished using your first approach? Why or why not?    How does this task affect your strategies to evaluate indefinite integrals?  For example, we have learned many methods to evaluate integrals. In what order would you try the method (like, what should be your go-to method); If you get stuck on a problem, what should you do?     It will be beneficial to have a strategic plan to evaluate integrals (like, if I see this, I should try this method; I should try this method before I try out a second method, or things like that to help you evaluate integrals). You don't have to include your strategic plan in your submission but it is a good idea to have one to help you determine which method you should use.  Stay tuned as Richard will update the \"official\" strategic plan here after the due date.     How do I know what method I should try...  Julie walked through the strategies in the lecture video (and I think a lot of you are following it as well). In the spirit of keeping an record of the methods we have learned, I put a brief strategic plan on the methods.    Always try simplification first! Do any algebraic simplification possible! If we can make the integrand a lot simpler to deal with, why not!?     -sub is the method you should try next. Recall -sub came from the chain rule you learned in calculus 1, which means you may want to be able to find the derivative of the choice of in the integrand. Long story short, the -sub formula is Just make sure you don't end up getting a more complicated integral after -sub.    If you see two functions being multiplied in the integrand, you may want to consider using integration by parts since this method came from the product rule in derivative. You will want to pick a and the rest of the integral will be the . Long story short, the integration by parts formula is You may be wondering how we can pick a to make the problem easier. There is an acronym \"LIPET\" to help us pick a good (you can look up the LIPET test if you want to know further). This acronym LIPET tells us that we should pick the in the following order:    L stands for Logarithmic functions;     I stands for Inverse Trigonometric functions;     P stands for Polynomial functions;     E stands for Exponential functions;     T stands for Trigonometric functions;   Well... Exponential and Trigonometric functions are equally complicated when picking them for the ...    There are also two special methods we learned that only works if the situation fits. They are:    Trigonometric Substitution : If you see in the integrand, you may consider using the substitution that . Likewise, if you see in the integrand, you may consider using the substitution that .     Partial Fraction Decomposition : If you see a complicated proper fraction where the denominator happens to be reducible (fancy way of saying factor-able), then partial fraction decomposition will help you split up the fraction to smaller pieces.       As you saw in this task that sometimes we can evaluate an integral using multiple methods. Trying easier method first is always a good idea. If you get stuck, try something else!    A bit historical background about this task...   I actually found this task from a research paper in math education in my first year PhD. The original problem was , which makes it a bit more complicated if a student attempted to try trig sub.  The result from that study showed that only about 50% of the students attempted the -sub in this problem. About 35% of them tried partial fraction decomposition and 15% of them used trig sub.  Well students trying -sub performed better in general compared to students who didn't try -sub in this problem since they have greater confidence and ample time for the rest of the exam. People trying trig sub spent too much time on this problem and often got stuck and doubt whether their answer was correct.  But the surprising finding here is that students using partial fraction decomposition or trig sub didn't switch method when they got stuck. They just kept on getting stuck using a complicated method.  I was shocked by the finding when I read this paper two years ago (there are more from this paper but this is the most shocking finding to me). I hope you all learn something from this task and the finding in terms of evaluating the integrals!     When you complete the tasks...  Come up with a strategic plan to evaluate integrals (you don't have to turn this in. Just make sure you have a plan that you can rely on when evaluating integrals in the future).  Then go to the next activity to explore how we can evaluate integrals using technology (and how reliable that can be).   "
